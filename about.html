No Hungry Child Charities’ aim for this campaign is "no child should be left hungry in India”. In a country where the rich-poor divide is stark and while millions splurge on good food, we find it unacceptable that even bigger millions of children have to go to bed hungry without any means for food or nutrition.
                We are passionate in our dedication to the cause of feeding under-privileged children across India. Towards this, we have ensured a high quality food supply chain and an uncontaminated route by which fresh, hot meals are supplied daily in controlled gatherings. All our operations are quality certified and are open for inspection by our donors at any time.
